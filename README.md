Module 4 School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

### This challenge was to assist Maria in understanding all of the collected data from diferent school districts on thier standardized test results. We are specifically looking at the math and reading results and making sure that the data has been cleaned and will not skew the results. This information will help the board understand where funding needs to go. In the first part of the challenge we needed to make sure that the data was clean and was free of any discrepencies and data to alter the results. We found that there was an issue with Thomas High School having non-student results included. When it was realized that Thomas High School had skewed data, we removed the input data for the 9th grade section of results as this was the area where there were discrepancies. After this data was removed from the data set we were able to adjust our code to reflect the new student count which was then used to run analysis on the school districts. 

## Results
